<h1 align="center">Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹, I'm Carson</h1>

Transforming complex challenges into elegant, scalable web solutions is my professional passion. As a Lead Software Engineer, I specialize in architecting high-performance applications using Node.js, React, and TypeScript. My recent work at Epic Hire demonstrates my ability to drive significant user growth, increasing the user base by developing responsive, intuitive interfaces that solve real-world problems.

I excel at:
- Building performant, user-centric web applications
- Enhancing backend architectures (10x API response improvement at previous role)
- Mentoring teams and driving engineering excellence
- Integrating cutting-edge technologies with business objectives

Whether it's launching a startup's MVP or scaling enterprise solutions, I bring technical expertise, collaborative spirit, and a relentless focus on creating exceptional user experiences.

Technology Stack: React, Next.js, TypeScript, AWS, GraphQL, Node.js, Scala, Java, PostgreSQL

I also own and run CWB Software Consulting LLC, which provides software consulting and software solutions.
